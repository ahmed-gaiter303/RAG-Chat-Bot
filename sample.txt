Welcome to the RAG Chat Bot sample document.

This file demonstrates how the bot can read your content and answer questions about it.

You can replace this text with your own documentation, reports, or manuals.
Ask questions like:
- What is this project about?
- How can this chatbot be used in a company?
- What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

RAG combines document retrieval with a language model
so that answers stay grounded in your data instead of hallucinating.
